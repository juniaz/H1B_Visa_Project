In summarizing the data by employer name, I encountered the following issues:

* Defined job opening location as Work Location, not Employer City

* Defined NYC job opening locations as EITHER Work Location 1 OR Work Location 2

* Data Cleaning: within the Work Location 1 and Work Location 2 columns, there exists several variations of "New York City"
  Addressed this by filtering data based on whether either columned contained 'NEW YORK' or 'NYC'
  
* Employer Names: Based on whether we would want to consider sub-brands as the same parent company or as separate entities,
  we could create additional groupings to better understand applicant volumes at an aggregated level
  Example: DELOITTE CONSULTING LLP, DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, DELOITTE TAX LLP, etc

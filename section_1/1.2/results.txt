Calculate the mean and standard deviation of wages proposed for workers located in New York City and Mountain View. 

The mean proposed annual wage rate in  New York is $89199.8
The mean proposed annual wage rate in  Mountain View is $104033.8
The standard deviation of the proposed annual wage rates in  New York is $68983.4
The standard deviation of the proposed annual wage rates in  Mountain View is $27223.8

Are the average wages in these two locations statistically different? 

The z-statistic for the two populations means is 38.98
The p-value for the two populations means is 0.0, therefore we reject the null hypothesis
We can say with 99% confidence that the average proposed wage in Mountain View is higher than that in New York

What factors could explain the results?

Job openings in Mountain View skew more to tech and engineering, which pay higher wages
The concentration of industries in Mountain View is mostly tech, with many large tech companies (eg. Google) headquartered there, driving up wage rates
In comparison, New York has a wider range of industries, including public sector, media, design, etc., which is why it shows a higher standard deviation

For NYC, what is the relationship between the total number of H-1B visas requested by an employer and the average wages proposed? 
Visually represent this relationship if appropriate. 

See PNG plots in folder: 
workers_vs_wage.png = full data plotting total foreign workers requested by employer (ie. sum(TOTAL WORKERS)) vs. average "WAGE RATE FROM" weighted by "TOTAL WORKERS" requested
workers_vs_wage.png = removed outliers to visualize the data better

Is the relationship statistically significant? What might explain this relationship?

Pearson's coefficient:
               total_workers  avg_wage
total_workers       1.000000 -0.000894
avg_wage           -0.000894  1.000000

The relationship is not statistically significant. 
The mode workers requested is 1 and as a result the proposed wage rate would vary widely depending on the type of occupation being filled.
For the higher number of workers requested, there would also be an unclear relationship as the average wage would depend heavily on the kinds of roles being filled.
In some cases, it may be a large tech company hiring for many software engineers (resulting in a high avg wage),
In other cases, it may be an agency/consultancy hiring for more junior-level roles (resulting in lower wages).
